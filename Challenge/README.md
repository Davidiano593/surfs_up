# surfs_up
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide exact information about the climate, depending on the time of year we want to find the precipitation levels as well as the summary of minimum and maximum temperatures, for this we use tools such as:
- VS Code
- Jupiter Notebook
- Python
- SQL
- Flask application
To achieve the desired results we work our code importing dependencies such as:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sqlalchemy
- Matplotlib

## Overview
We are looking for an investor to be able to create a surfing equipment and ice cream business and be able to move to an island in Hawaii, for this we must collect data on the weather, since our investor does not want to take risks in which we have to close our store very often and the greatest risk we find are external factors such as temperatures, which is something we cannot control, but we can analyze them based on historical data by collecting climate information for different years.

## Results
We have compared two different months of the year, the month of June and the month of December, which gives us a clear idea since we have divided the year into two semi-annual parts; Below we show the statistical data for the month of June:

We can see that the average temperature for the month of June is:
- 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit
- The minimum temperature is 64 degrees
- The maximum temperature is 85 degrees

Los datos del mes de diciembre son los siguientes:

We can see that the average temperature for the month of December is:
- 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit
- The minimum temperature is 56 degrees
- The maximum temperature is 83 degrees

## Summary

When comparing the data from both months, we can conclude that the temperatures are adequate to keep the store open during the year, the variability is not so high.
- While in the month of June we have an average temperature of 74.94 degrees, in the month of December it is 71.04.
- The June minimum is 64 degrees and December is 56 degrees, which is acceptable.
- The maximum temperature for the month of June is 85 degrees and December is 83 degrees.
The climatic conditions are adequate to be able to open the store and to maintain it in the future, for which I can conclude that based on the climatic information the business is viable.
